Growing up in the small mining town of Butte, Montana, Sean watched the sun rise over the East Ridge, which is the section of the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide that overlooks Butte. Not long after he was old enough to walk, he started hiking the hills and mountains that make up the East Ridge, which is where he developed his love for being outside and no doubt had something to do with his decision to join the Marine Corps.

When he returns home today, one of his favorite things is getting up early, grabbing a cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise over the East Ridge, reminding him that every day is a new opportunity.
